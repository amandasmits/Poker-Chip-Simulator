# pokerchip-simulator
I thought of this one while we were playing poker camping, without an actual physical set of poker chips it would be inconvenient to keep track of the betting and everyone's current balance, so this is a digital simulator that does that. While you're playing you enter the name of whover was betting and how much they wanted to bet, then it keeps track of all the bets in the round (which is the pot). Then it asks if someone has won the round, and if they have won the round it adds the pot to their total and prints everyone's totals. After every round it asks if the game continues, until the end then it calculates the winner and outputs it. It doesn't keep track of whose turn it is (that could be another version later) or calculate if someone has gone into the negatives. This version isn't to keep track of the game at all, it's purely meant to hold the value of everyone's account and the current pot and keep the users aware of it. It can't replace the satisfaction of slamming the chips down on the table when betting or stealing them from your opponent but maybe that could be another version later too.
